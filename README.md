## Difference for Web
This project was to create an website that would round up users' credit card purchases to the next dollar, and donate the difference to charity.

The members of our team that worked on this application were:

Stephen Fessler: Worked on web side of the application. Did overall layout, including sidebar, coloring and charity page.
Sean Kallungal: Worked on web side of the application. Worked on the charity search, as well as displaying the donation statistics.

The framework that we used as sample code:
